During my time as a Software Engineering student I worked for a couple of months at the Winc Academy. The Winc Academy is
an online academy where people can learn programming from experienced teachers. The programming studies are done remotely
and contact with the students was done via the Slack channel.

## Summary

My activities within the Winc Academy consisted of checking the assignments made by the students based on different acceptance
criteria and general programming best practices and patterns. Checked assignments were graded, the results communicated with 
the student and the administration in the version control system updated. Next to that I answered any programming related questions
from the students in the Slack channel. When doing that it was important to communicate with the students clearly and formulate
constructive feedback that a student can use to progress further.

I did this job completely remotely because of the current global pandemic. During which close contact with teammates and
colleagues was established with frequent video calls and textual communication.
