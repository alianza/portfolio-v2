# Team Rockstars IT

After graduating from my Software Engineering studies at the University of Applied sciences in Amsterdam I was ready to start looking
for my first real job. I started applying to some companies and set my LinkedIn profile to "Looking for a job". This caused
a huge surge in phone calls of parties interested in hiring me which became a bit overwhelming at some point. After having interviews
at a number of companies I got a number of contractual offers from a variety of parties. One of which was Team Rockstars IT, which I
ended up choosing as my first employer because there was quite a good fit between me and the company and the people I've spoken with.
