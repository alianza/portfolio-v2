description: This project was my second attempt at creating a React library. This time I wanted to create a generic table component library
  that could be used to render feature rich but simple to use tables in react with built-in animations, out-of-the-box sorting, support for actions
  in an action column and more. The library was built using React and TailwindCss so it's lightweight.
