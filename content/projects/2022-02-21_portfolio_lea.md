# Journalistic Portfolio Website for Lea Shamaa

<hr />

As I was looking for new personal projects to pursue and my girlfriend was entering the journalistic world and needed an online presence where she could show-off her past experiences and projects. Much like the personal portfolio website you are reading this on right now but then in the context of journalism instead of software engineering.

The website needed be easy to manage in terms of adding new content, articles and basic customization. I continued to build on my go-to tech stack which includes Next.js as full-stack framework and DecapCMS (Formerly NetlfyCMS) as content management system hosted on Netlify. All styling was done using TailwindCSS and TailwindCSS Prose for the article styling. Content is saved from the CMS directly into the repository through automatic Pull-Requests after which new builds are triggered through Continuous Integration with Netlify as well as preview deployements for Drafted changes in the CMS.
