# Road.io (Formerly E-Flux)

My position at Road.io (Formerly E-Flux) (via Team Rockstars IT) is a full-stack web developer within their development team. E-Flux is a company that makes software to support and manage the charging of electric vehicles with thousands of customers and various providers who license our software. Within my position I work on the various software systems that support the business operations of the company E-Flux. Technologies used are React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose and much more. The system is based on many different components and IOT concepts, so network communication is also highly relevant. I was able to further develop various parts of the software systems, including front-end improvements for users and administrators, new features/screens, new/extended API calls, 3rd party integrations with our system, and general maintenance of the entire system.

For a large part I was active in the Roaming team within the Road.io (Formerly E-Flux) engineering team which was responsible for ensuring the roaming capabilities of the chargers we operate to allow other charging networks' users to utilize them and vice versa.

I started working with Road.io when they were still a start-up with a very small development team (less than 3 full time engineers) and worked with them for about 2 years. Within that time I was able to see the company grow and expand their engineering team and development ambitions.
