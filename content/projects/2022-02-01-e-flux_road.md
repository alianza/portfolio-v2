description: My first project via Team Rockstars IT was working as a Full-Stack Engineere for Road.io (Formerly E-Flux). Road.io develops and maintains a platform for electric vehicle charging and management. I worked on the back-end of the platform, which is built with Node.js and MongoDB. I also worked on the front-end, which is built with React and Semantic UI.
