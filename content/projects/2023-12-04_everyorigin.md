description: EveryOrigin is a free CORS proxy service that allows developers to circumvent CORS restrictions
  on websites that don't allow cross-origin requests. The service is free and open-source and was inspired by
  similar services like allorigins.win and whateverorigin.org. The service is built using Next.js and is hosted
  on Netlify.
